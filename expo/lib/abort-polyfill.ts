/**
 * Monkey-patches the global AbortController so that every `abort()` call
 * always carries a reason.  Without this, React Native's Hermes engine
 * throws `"signal is aborted without reason"` whenever anything accesses
 * `signal.reason` on an unreasoned abort — and the Supabase JS client
 * (GoTrue / realtime) creates AbortControllers internally without passing
 * a reason.
 *
 * Import this file as early as possible — before any module that might
 * instantiate an AbortController.
